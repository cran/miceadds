        (reported by Simon Grund)
ADDED * added Spearman rank correlation for 'micombine.cor' and
        an example for statistical inference for Kendalls
        tau (see 'micombine.cor', Example 2)
        (suggested by Kathleen Gali)

        data
ADDED * included 'NMIcombine' function as an extension to
        'MIcombine' (mitools package) to nested multiply
        imputed datasets
ADDED * included function 'NMIwaldtest' which performs a multi-

        determining visit sequence for an imputation model when passive 
        variables are involved

        imputation generating objects of class 'mids.nmi'

        'mids.nmi' producing objects of class 'mira' (defined in mice)
        and 'mira.nmi'. For 'mira.nmi', a summary method is defined. 
ADDED * added 'within' S3 methods for objects of class 'imputationList'
        (which are defined in the mitools package) 
ADDED * added statistical inference for nested multiply imputed datasets
        in 'pool.mids.nmi' function

        standard errors for 'lm' and 'glm' functions using the 
        multiwaycov package (and the function 'cluster.vcov' therein)
ADDED * added function 'NestedImputationList' function for creating objects
        of class 'NestedImputationList'. S3 Methods 'with' and 'within' are
        defined for operating on this list of lists of datasets.
        The S3 method 'MIcombine' (from mitools package) is extended
        to objects of class 'Nested ImputationResultList'.
